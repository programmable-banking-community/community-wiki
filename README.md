## ✨ About

**The Programmable Banking Community** is a community of 500+ software devs on a mission.

We want to make Programmable Banking a reality for South African developers and businesses: by building open source tech with Investec Programmable Banking foundations. [Learn more](https://www.offerzen.com/community/investec/).

**The purpose of the community is threefold:**

1. Share ideas and code to help each other unlock the potential of Programmable Banking.
2. Give the Investec Product Team honest and critical feedback on what we want to improve.
3. Get the businesses where we work to build commercial value with [Programmable Business Banking](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSzZVMj7pM7ERf9VC5k2igNjIpcEgPgNCcnvL1cJMMJV8riUypeejrXLMALiWPbFCXv2pe95thsIdvL/pub?start=false\&loop=false\&delayms=3000).
