## What's this Doc All About?

Hi there, folks! We've got some big news about our Programmable Banking Community. We're shaking things up a bit, and this document serves as your guide to what's happening. We're eager to hear your thoughts and feedback.

## A Quick Look Back

The journey of our Programmable Banking community is a tale of collaboration and innovation. Born from a [partnership between Investec and OfferZen/Make](https://www.offerzen.com/blog/building-a-programmable-bank-account-for-developers-part-2), we set out to empower developers to create their own banking experiences. Together, we've grown into a thriving ecosystem of developers, innovators, and tech enthusiasts.

**Now, we're poised to start** [**the next chapter**](https://www.offerzen.com/blog/programmable-banking-part-3). We're transitioning from the Make (OfferZen) Slack workspace to our own dedicated Programmable Banking Slack workspace. **We're taking ownership of the community and aiming to shape its future into a self-sustaining entity**. We can't wait to see where this journey takes us!

**But why, you might ask?** Why do we have to move? The answer lies in our desire to provide a more tailored and enriched experience for our community members. As our community has grown, so have our needs and aspirations. **Having our own workspace will allow us more control, enabling us to implement features and improvements for our community**. It also allows us to streamline our operations, making it easier to manage and support the community.

Moreover, this move is a testament to the growth and maturity of our community. It's a sign that we're ready to stand on our own, take charge of our destiny, and shape our future. It's a step towards becoming a more self-sustaining community that continues to foster innovation and collaboration in the Programmable Banking space.

We understand that change can be challenging, and we're committed to making this transition as smooth and seamless as possible. We're here to support you every step of the way and we're excited about the opportunities this move presents.

## Our Hopes and Dreams

Our top priority is ensuring this transition is as smooth as possible for all members. We want to keep everyone in the loop, feeling supported, and excited about this change. After all, we're all in this together.

## The Plan

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/[EXTERNAL] V2 Proposed Community Migration Timeline.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><p>[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tv52j604X6hDCLfTYRuGIzycCLS_n1XF/view?usp=sharing">Source image here</a>]</p></figcaption></figure>

**We've thought long and hard about this move**. It's not just about changing where we hang out online, but also about what this means for our community. Here's a snapshot of what to expect:

* **Step 1:** We're launching our dedicated Programmable Banking Slack workspace in August. You'll receive an invitation to join us there. ([Slack migration guide here](quick-slack-guide.md))
* **Step 2:** We'll host a series of virtual office hours. This is your chance to learn more about the transition, ask questions, and share your thoughts.
* **Step 3**: Gradually, we'll start migrating activities and discussions from the current Slack workspace to the new Programmable Banking Slack workspace. We'll ensure all key resources and information are transferred too.
* **Step 4:** Finally, once everyone's settled in the new workspace, we'll retire the old Slack channels. **But don’t worry, no one will be removed from the Offerzen Workspace**. Instead, all the engaging Programmable Banking discussions will be happening in a dedicated Workspace.

We'll keep you updated and support you throughout the process. 💚

## What's Next?

This move opens up a world of new possibilities. We're talking more resources, top-notch support, and a whole new level of community experience. You'll continue to enjoy regular meetups, bounties, hackathons, and collaborative projects. Plus, you'll be the first to learn about new initiatives and opportunities in our Programmable Banking ecosystem. We can't wait to see the fantastic things you'll create in this vibrant and dynamic environment.
